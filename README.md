# Perfect Simulation for the Loss Network Point Process

The file *perfect_simulation.py* implements a class responsible to
perform the perfect simulation for the Loss Network Point Process.

The file **persistent_homology_perfect_simulatio.py** implemets an exemple
on how to use the class described above. The output is the persistent
homology obtained from the point process of the invariant measure calculated 
from **perfect_simulation.py**, on
the interval $I=[a, b] \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.
