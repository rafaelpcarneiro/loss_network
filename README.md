# Perfect Simulation for the Loss Network Point Process

The file *perfect_simulation.py* implements a class responsible to
perform the perfect simulation for the Loss Network Point Process.

The file *persistent_homology_perfect_simulatio.py* implemets an exemple
on how to use the class described above and calculates its persistent
homology, obtained from an invariant measure calculated on
an interval $$I$$.
